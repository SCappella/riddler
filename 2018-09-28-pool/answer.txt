In particular, one such formation is

    0
   0 1
  1 0 0
 8 1 1 0
1 0 0 1 1

where 0 is solid, 1 is stripe and 8 is the eight ball. Hopefully this format is readable to you. It looks better in a monospaced font.

This was essentially found with brute force. I thought of a formation as a list of positions of stripes, a list of positions of solids, and the position of the eight ball (each position is a number 1-15). I then encoded each of the possible transformations. Note that swapping two stripes or two solids makes no difference.

Since these operations are symmetric, it suffices to see which formations get reached last if every operation is applied to every formation that's been reached so far. I started with the final position and applied every operation to get a new set of formations. Repeating 6 times nets all 51,480 (=15!/(1!*7!*7!)) formations.

To find the extra credit answer, I looped through every possible starting position and found the distance to the furthest formation. The problem was just small enough that I could solve this without much optimization. The longest path started at
